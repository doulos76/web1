    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="CSS" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a></strong>is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside THML and JavaScript</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
